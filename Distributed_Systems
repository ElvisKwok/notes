1 Introduction

-1.1 Definition of a distributed system
    a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system.
    * hardware: autonomous
    * software: appear as a single system

-1.2 Goals
  1.2.1 Connecting users and resources
    easy to access and share remote resources
  1.2.2 Transparency
    hide the fact that resources are distributed across mulitple computers
    several aspects: access, location, migration, relocation, replication, concurrency, failure, persistence
    degrees of transparency
  1.2.3 Openness
    offers services according to standard rules, services are specified through interfaces, described in an IDL
    separating policy from mechanism
  1.2.4 Scalability
    3 dimensions: size, geographically scalable, administratively scalable
    scalability problems
    scaling techniques: hiding communication latencies(time), distribution, replication
